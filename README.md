# Dog-or-Cat

A local web application to deploy an image classifier that predicts whether the image contains either a dog or a cat. Users can upload an image of a dog or a cat, and the model will return prediction on the webâ€™s interface. The model deployment is done by Flask.

After cloning the repository, users can run the ```Cats_vs_Dogs.ipynb``` in the ```model``` folder to modify the model's training process (if needed). After running the file, our image classifier will be saved in the ```model``` folder. 

Finally, run the ```app.py``` file, and an IP address will appear. That will be the IP address for the application. 

Our web should look like the image below.
